@Data is a convenient shortcut annotation that bundles the features of @ToString,
@EqualsAndHashCode, @Getter / @Setter and @RequiredArgsConstructor together: In other words,
@Data generates all the boilerplate that is normally associated with simple POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) and beans:
getters for all fields, setters for all non-final fields, and appropriate toString,
equals and hashCode implementations that involve the fields of the class,
and a constructor that initializes all final fields, as well as all non-final fields with no initializer
that have been marked with @NonNull, in order to ensure the field is never null.
